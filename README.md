# spisula-solidis
This repository contains scripts and some summary information for the Atlantic surfclam (*Spisula solidissima solidissima*) genetic population structure manuscript. The genomic data identified, for the first time, morphologically cryptic, deep population structure within *S.s. solidissima* and inferred population connectivity.
